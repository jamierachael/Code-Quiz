### Summary
* HTML and CSS and Javascript documents create a random password generator 
* This project emphasizes the use of using Javascript to make dynamic changes to an HMTL document

### This project has the following features: 
* A generate button
    * This will send the user a series of prompts and confirms
    * After user data is collected, a random password will be generated using Javascript
* A Textarea
    * This textarea will display the users password once it is generated
* A Copy buttom 
    * This will copy the users password to the user's devices clipboard

### Psuedo code: 
* The user will be prompted to choose from the following password criteria: 8 and 128 characters
* The user will recieve a confirm for: 
    * Password containing special characters, numbers, and uppercase
    * Either 4 variables individual ones, or 3 with toLowerCase to Uppercase conversion
    * This will need to randomly generate a selection or randomly select array data, so math.random and math.floor will need to be used.     
* The application should validate user input and ensure that at least one character type is selected.
    * If, else if statement (similar to car input)
* Once all prompts are answered, the user will be presented with a password matching the answered prompts. Displaying the generated password in an alert is acceptable, but attempt to write the password to the page instead.
    * Event listener will determine the password output with function to populate the value into the test area.
* As a bonus, the user should also have the option to click a button to copy the password to their clipboard.
    * Copy execCommand in event listener

### This project has script features of:
* Variable declaration area 
* An event listener (onclick) called generatePassword
    * This will prompt the user for input between 8-128
    * This variable is changed to an interger using ParseInt()
    * This will validate that the input is a number within range, or is a number
    * This then uses the input to determine the types (or choices) or letters of characters used, using an if statement
    * This then assigns values to the variables using arrays for character, number or alphabet
* Another variable is created to concatenate the above variables
* A for loop will loop through the enter prompt until it reaches the number entered by user. 
* A password variable takes the value from the for loop, and converts it to a string. 
* The string value then populates into the text area for the user using a UserInput function.
* An event listener (onlick) has also been created for the copy to clipboard feauture. 

### This project has media Queries for:
* max-width: 980px 
    * Adjusts body and container width
* max-width: 786px
    * Adjusts body and container width
    * Adjusts buttons
* max-width: 640px
    * Adjusts body and container width
    * Adjusts buttons to be centered and stacked
